🛠️ Technology Overview
Backend

A server-side system that processes user messages

Handles user requests and generates appropriate responses

Manages chatbot logic and conversation flow

Frontend

A web-based interface that allows users to interact with the chatbot

Displays messages in a chat-style layout

Provides interactive UI elements such as buttons and theme switching

🧠 How It Works

The user enters a message through the chat interface.

The chatbot analyzes the message to understand the user’s intent.

Based on the intent, the chatbot determines the appropriate response.

In certain cases, the chatbot asks follow-up questions to gather more information.

The response is displayed back to the user in the chat window.

The chatbot follows a hybrid approach, combining natural language understanding with predefined conversational rules to ensure accurate and consistent responses.

🎯 Purpose of the Project

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how a customer service chatbot can be built to handle basic user interactions efficiently. It helps in understanding conversational systems, chatbot workflows, and real-world customer support automation.

⚠️ Limitations

The chatbot is designed for handling common and predefined customer service queries.

It does not generate responses dynamically like advanced AI systems.

Complex or unrelated questions may not always receive accurate responses.
